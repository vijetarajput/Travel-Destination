                    <h2>Why Varanasi?</h2>
                    <h3>One of the Holiest Cities in India</h3>
                    <p>Powerful Spiritual Significance. Varanasi is the spiritual capital of Hinduism, which is
                        simultaneously
                        a religion and an everyday way of life for the locals of this holy city. The significance comes
                        from
                        the
                        river Ganges, which Hindus believe is a rare 'tirtha' where the spiritual and physical realms
                        meet.
                        Former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru called the Ganges “the river of India…beloved of her
                        people…a
                        symbol of India’s age-long culture and civilization.” Witnessing the rituals of the river is a
                        powerful,
                        fantastically overwhelming experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>Varanasi is perhaps the greatest location of the Hindu faith. Every devout Hindu hopes to visit
                        the
                        river
                        at least once in their life. The journey and process is an intense one. Many Hindu women from
                        all
                        over
                        Southern India will donate their entire head of hair as an offering to the gods. They will bathe
                        in
                        the
                        five great ghats (embankment steps) along the river. They start at Assi, then Dashashwamedh, Adi
                        Keshav
                        (Varuna-sangam), Panchganga and, finally, Manikarnika ghat. This last one is a burning ghat
                        where
                        Hindus
                        are cremated after death. The entire lives of millions of people are
                        centered around this river.</p>
